### Hello there! 👋🏾

I'm a CS PhD student at Queen's University Belfast researching fake news detection using unsupervised machine learning.
My focus is on creating algorithms for detecting misinformation in news articles using mostly textual information.

I enjoy designing things and painting. I sometimes write about my (computational and other) explorations on my [blog](https://martinssamuel.com/).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on misinformation detection using topic modelling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about stocks and markets.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on research on spread of misinformation in African countries.
- 💬 Ask me about Computational Thinking and Design Thinking.
